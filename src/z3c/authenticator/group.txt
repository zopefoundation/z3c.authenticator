Group
=====

Group container provide support for groups information stored in the ZODB. 
They are persistent, and must be contained within the IAuthentication that 
use them.


Group
-----

Like other users, groups are created when they are needed.

  >>> from z3c.authenticator import interfaces
  >>> from z3c.authenticator.group import Group
  >>> group1 = Group(u'groups')
  >>> group1
  <Group None>

  >>> interfaces.IGroup.providedBy(group1)
  True

  >>> group1.title
  u'groups'

  >>> group1.description
  u''

  >>> group1.principals
  ()


GroupContainer
--------------

Group containers contain IGroup objects. A IAuthentication will adapt
IFoundGroup to this IGroup objects.

  >>> from z3c.authenticator.group import GroupContainer
  >>> groups = GroupContainer('groups.')

  >>> interfaces.IGroupContainer.providedBy(groups)
  True

We can add your previous created group to the group container using the 
addGroup method which returns the group id and group:

  >>> gid, g1 = groups.addGroup(u'g1', group1)
  >>> gid
  u'groups.g1'

  >>> interfaces.IGroup.providedBy(g1)
  True

  >>> g1.__name__
  u'groups.g1'

Note that when group is added, a GroupAdded event is generated:

  >>> from zope.component.eventtesting import getEvents
  >>> getEvents(interfaces.IGroupAdded)
  [<GroupAdded u'groups.g1'>]

Groups are defined with respect to an authentication service. Groups must be 
accessible via an authentication service and can contain principals accessible
via an authentication service. To illustrate the group interaction with the 
authentication service, we will setup a Authenticator utility:

  >>> from z3c.authenticator.authentication import Authenticator
  >>> authenticator = Authenticator()

Give them a location and register them as a IAuthentication utility :

  >>> import zope.component
  >>> from zope.app.security.interfaces import IAuthentication
  >>> rootFolder['authenticator'] = authenticator
  >>> zope.component.provideUtility(authenticator, IAuthentication)

We will create and register a new principals utility:

  >>> zope.component.provideUtility(authenticator, IAuthentication)

We also need to register the group athentication plugin:

  >>> zope.component.provideUtility(groups, 
  ...     provides=interfaces.IAuthenticatorPlugin, 
  ...     name='My Group Plugin')

After setup the group and group container, we will create a simple credentials 
plugin and add them to the authentication utility:

  >>> import zope.interface
  >>> from z3c.authenticator import interfaces

  >>> class MyCredentialsPlugin(object):
  ...
  ...     zope.interface.implements(interfaces.ICredentialsPlugin)
  ...
  ...     def extractCredentials(self, request):
  ...         return {'login':request.get('login', ''), 
  ...                 'password':request.get('password', '')}
  ...
  ...     def challenge(self, request):
  ...         pass # challenge is a no-op for this plugin
  ...
  ...     def logout(self, request):
  ...         pass # logout is a no-op for this plugin

and configure and add the credential plugin to the Authenticator:

  >>> myCredentialsPlugin = MyCredentialsPlugin()
  >>> authenticator['credentials'] = myCredentialsPlugin
  >>> authenticator.credentialsPlugins = ('credentials', )

We also need a principal and a IAuthenticationPlugin:

  >>> from z3c.authenticator.user import User
  >>> p1 = User(u'p1', u'password', u'Principal 1')
  >>> p2 = User(u'p2', u'password', u'Principal 2')
  >>> p3 = User(u'p3', u'password', u'Principal 3')
  >>> p4 = User(u'p4', u'password', u'Principal 4')

  >>> from z3c.authenticator.user import UserContainer
  >>> users = UserContainer()
  >>> token1, p1 = users.add(p1)
  >>> token2, p2 = users.add(p2)
  >>> token3, p3 = users.add(p3)
  >>> token4, p4 = users.add(p4)

Add the GroupContainer and UserContainer to the Authenticator and 
set the correct plugin names

  >>> authenticator['users'] = users
  >>> authenticator['groups'] = groups
  >>> authenticator.authenticatorPlugins = ('users', 'groups')


Adding users to groups
----------------------

Now we can set the users on the group but first we need to register the
IFoundPrincipal adapter for groups. The GroupPrincipal adapter provides this
interface:

  >>> from z3c.authenticator.group import GroupPrincipal
  >>> zope.component.provideAdapter(GroupPrincipal, 
  ...     provides=interfaces.IFoundPrincipal)

And we also need to provide the IFoundPrincipal and IAuthenticatedPrincipal
adapter for IPrincipal objects:

  >>> from z3c.authenticator.principal import AuthenticatedPrincipal
  >>> from z3c.authenticator.principal import FoundPrincipal
  >>> zope.component.provideAdapter(AuthenticatedPrincipal, 
  ...     provides=interfaces.IAuthenticatedPrincipal)

  >>> zope.component.provideAdapter(FoundPrincipal, 
  ...     provides=interfaces.IFoundPrincipal)

And we need the ``setGroupsForPrincipal`` subscriber:

  >>> from z3c.authenticator.group import setGroupsForPrincipal
  >>> zope.component.provideHandler(setGroupsForPrincipal, 
  ...     [interfaces.IPrincipalCreated])

  >>> g1.principals = [p1.__name__, p2.__name__]
  >>> g1.principals
  (..., ...)

  >>> g1.principals[0] == p1.__name__
  True

  >>> g1.principals[1] == p2.__name__
  True

Adding users fires an event.

  >>> getEvents(interfaces.IPrincipalsAddedToGroup)[-1]
  <PrincipalsAddedToGroup [..., ...] u'groups.g1'>

We can now look up groups for the users:

  >>> groups.getGroupsForPrincipal(p1.__name__)
  (u'groups.g1',)

Note that the group id is a concatenation of the group-folder prefix
and the name of the group object within the folder.

If we delete a group:

  >>> del groups['groups.g1']

then the groups folder loses the group information for that group's users:

  >>> groups.getGroupsForPrincipal('p1')
  ()

but the principal information on the group is unchanged:

  >>> g1.principals
  (..., ...)

  >>> g1.principals[0] == p1.__name__
  True

  >>> g1.principals[1] == p2.__name__
  True

It also fires an event showing that the users are removed from the groups.

  >>> getEvents(interfaces.IPrincipalsRemovedFromGroup)[-1]
  <PrincipalsRemovedFromGroup [..., ...] 'groups.g1'>

Adding the group again within a different name will make the groups 
available for the principal. Let's use a different group name:

  >>> groups['groups.G1'] = g1

  >>> groups.getGroupsForPrincipal(p1.__name__)
  (u'groups.G1',)

Here we see that the new name is reflected in the group information.

An event is fired, as usual.

  >>> getEvents(interfaces.IPrincipalsAddedToGroup)[-1]
  <PrincipalsAddedToGroup [..., ...] u'groups.G1'>

In terms of member events (members added and removed from groups), we have
now seen that events are fired when a group object is added and when it is 
removed from a group container; and we have seen that events are fired
when a principal is added to an already-registered groups.  Events are also
fired when a principal is removed from an already-registered groups.  Let's
quickly see some more examples.

  >>> g1.principals = (p1.__name__, p3.__name__, p4.__name__)
  >>> g1.principals
  (..., ..., ...)

  >>> g1.principals[0] == p1.__name__
  True

  >>> g1.principals[1] == p3.__name__
  True

  >>> g1.principals[2] == p4.__name__
  True

  >>> getEvents(interfaces.IPrincipalsAddedToGroup)[-1]
  <PrincipalsAddedToGroup [..., ...] u'groups.G1'>

  >>> getEvents(interfaces.IPrincipalsRemovedFromGroup)[-1]
  <PrincipalsRemovedFromGroup [...] u'groups.G1'>

  >>> g1.principals = (p1.__name__, p2.__name__)
  >>> g1.principals
  (..., ...)

  >>> g1.principals[0] == p1.__name__
  True

  >>> g1.principals[1] == p2.__name__
  True

  >>> getEvents(interfaces.IPrincipalsAddedToGroup)[-1]
  <PrincipalsAddedToGroup [...] u'groups.G1'>

  >>> getEvents(interfaces.IPrincipalsRemovedFromGroup)[-1]
  <PrincipalsRemovedFromGroup [..., ...] u'groups.G1'>

  >>> groups.getGroupsForPrincipal(p2.__name__)
  (u'groups.G1',)


Groups in groups
----------------

Groups can contain groups:

  >>> g2 = Group('Group Two')
  >>> groups['groups.G2'] = g2
  >>> g2.principals
  ()
  
  >>> g2.principals = ['groups.G1']

  >>> g2.principals
  ('groups.G1',)

  >>> groups.getGroupsForPrincipal('groups.G2')
  ()

  >>> g1.principals
  (..., ...)

  >>> g1.principals[0] == p1.__name__
  True

  >>> g1.principals[1] == p2.__name__
  True

  >>> groups.getGroupsForPrincipal('groups.G1')
  (u'groups.G2',)

  >>> old = getEvents(interfaces.IPrincipalsAddedToGroup)[-1]
  >>> old
  <PrincipalsAddedToGroup ['groups.G1'] u'groups.G2'>

Groups cannot contain cycles:

  >>> g1.principals
  (..., ...)

  >>> g1.principals[0] == p1.__name__
  True

  >>> g1.principals[1] == p2.__name__
  True

  >>> g2.principals
  ('groups.G1',)

  >>> g1.principals = (p1.__name__, p2.__name__, 'groups.G2')
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  GroupCycle: (...)

  >>> g1.principals
  (..., ...)

  >>> g1.principals[0] == p1.__name__
  True

  >>> g1.principals[1] == p2.__name__
  True

Trying to do so does not fire an event.

  >>> getEvents(interfaces.IPrincipalsAddedToGroup)[-1] is old
  True

They need not be hierarchical:

  >>> ga = Group("Group A")
  >>> groups['groups.GA'] = ga

  >>> gb = Group("Group B")
  >>> groups['groups.GB'] = gb
  >>> gb.principals = ['groups.GA']

  >>> gc = Group("Group C")
  >>> groups['groups.GC'] = gc
  >>> gc.principals = ['groups.GA']

  >>> gd = Group("Group D")
  >>> groups['groups.GD'] = gd
  >>> gd.principals = ['groups.GA', 'groups.GB']

  >>> ga.principals = [p1.__name__]

Group containers provide a very simple search interface.  They perform
simple string searches on group titles and descriptions.

  >>> list(groups.search({'search': 'grou'}))
  [u'groups.G1', u'groups.G2',
   u'groups.GA', u'groups.GB', u'groups.GC', u'groups.GD']

  >>> list(groups.search({'search': 'two'}))
  [u'groups.G2']

They also support batching:

  >>> list(groups.search({'search': 'grou'}, 2, 3))
  [u'groups.GA', u'groups.GB', u'groups.GC']


If you don't supply a search key, no results will be returned:

  >>> list(groups.search({}))
  []

Identifying groups
------------------

The function, `setGroupsForPrincipal`, is a subscriber to
principal-creation events.  It adds any group-folder-defined groups to
users in those groups:

  >>> auth1 = authenticator.getPrincipal(p1.__name__)

  >>> auth1.groups
  [u'groups.G1', u'groups.GA']

Of course, this applies to groups too:

  >>> g1 = authenticator.getPrincipal('groups.G1')
  >>> g1.id
  u'groups.G1'

  >>> g1.groups
  [u'groups.G2']

A GroupPrincipal provides IGroupPrincipal which is inherited from 
IFoundPrincipal and IGroup:

  >>> interfaces.IGroupPrincipal.providedBy(g1)
  True

  >>> interfaces.IFoundPrincipal.providedBy(g1)
  True

  >>> import zope.security.interfaces
  >>> zope.security.interfaces.IGroup.providedBy(g1)
  True


Special groups
--------------

Two special groups, Authenticated, and Everyone may apply to users
created by the pluggable-authentication utility.  There is a
subscriber, specialGroups, that will set these groups on any non-group
users if IAuthenticatedGroup, or IEveryoneGroup utilities are
provided.

If we notify the subscriber with the principal, nothing will happen
because the groups haven't been defined:

  >>> from z3c.authenticator.principal import FoundPrincipal
  >>> from z3c.authenticator.event import FoundPrincipalCreated
  >>> from z3c.authenticator.group import specialGroups
  >>> x = User('x', 'password', 'X')
  >>> found = FoundPrincipal(x)
  >>> event = FoundPrincipalCreated(authenticator, found)
  >>> specialGroups(event)
  >>> found.groups
  []

Now, if we define the Everybody group:

  >>> import zope.app.security.interfaces
  >>> class EverybodyGroup(GroupPrincipal):
  ...     zope.interface.implements(
  ...        zope.app.security.interfaces.IEveryoneGroup)

  >>> all = Group('groups.all')
  >>> groups['groups.all'] = all
  >>> everybody = EverybodyGroup(all)
  >>> zope.component.provideUtility(everybody,
  ...     zope.app.security.interfaces.IEveryoneGroup)

Then the group will be added to the principal:

  >>> specialGroups(event)
  >>> found.groups
  [u'groups.all']

Similarly for the authenticated group:

  >>> class AuthenticatedGroup(GroupPrincipal):
  ...     zope.interface.implements(
  ...         zope.app.security.interfaces.IAuthenticatedGroup)

  >>> authenticated = Group('groups.authenticated')
  >>> groups['groups.authenticated'] = authenticated
  >>> authenticated = AuthenticatedGroup(authenticated)
  >>> zope.component.provideUtility(authenticated,
  ...     zope.app.security.interfaces.IAuthenticatedGroup)

Then the group will be added to the principal:

  >>> found.groups = []
  >>> specialGroups(event)
  >>> found.groups.sort()
  >>> found.groups
  [u'groups.all', u'groups.authenticated']

The `allGroups` attribute is a readonly iterable of the full closure of the
groups in the `groups` attribute--that is, if the principal is a direct member
of the 'Administrators' group, and the 'Administrators' group is a member of
the 'Reviewers' group, then p.groups would be ['Administrators'] and 
list(p.allGroups) would be ['Administrators', 'Reviewers'].

  >>> sorted(found.allGroups)
  [u'groups.all', u'groups.authenticated']


These groups are only added to non-group principals:

  >>> found.groups = []
  >>> zope.interface.directlyProvides(found, zope.security.interfaces.IGroup)
  >>> specialGroups(event)
  >>> found.groups
  []

And they are only added to group aware principals:

  >>> class SolitaryPrincipal:
  ...     zope.interface.implements(zope.security.interfaces.IPrincipal)
  ...     id = title = description = ''

  >>> event = FoundPrincipalCreated(authenticator, SolitaryPrincipal())
  >>> specialGroups(event)
  >>> found.groups
  []



UserAwareGroup
----------------

We can manages groups via the group getUser and setUser methods:

  >>> foundGroup = interfaces.IFoundPrincipal(g1)
  >>> foundGroup.getUsers()
  (..., ...)

  >>> foundGroup.getUsers()[0] == p1.__name__
  True

  >>> foundGroup.getUsers()[1] == p2.__name__
  True

Let's remove a member from the group:

  >>> foundGroup.setUsers((p2.__name__,))
  >>> foundGroup.getUsers()
  (...,)

  >>> foundGroup.getUsers()[0] == p2.__name__
  True

  >>> foundGroup.members
  (...,)

  >>> foundGroup.getUsers()[0] == p2.__name__
  True

Ensure that such a group provides the IMemberAwareGroup interfaces.

  >>> zope.security.interfaces.IMemberAwareGroup.providedBy(foundGroup)
  True
